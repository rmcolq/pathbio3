    "We will now use these results for GO and metabolic pathway analysis using the TriTrypDB and PlasmoDB websites. Full details of how to do this are in the presentation, but a summary is provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to perform either GO or metabolic pathway analysis on your chosen dataset, or both if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these analyses you will need either a text list of gene IDs which can be pasted into the website field, or by uploading a text file. You should create a separate list for up regulated and down regulated genes for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GO Analysis\n",
    "For this you will need either a text list of gene IDs which can be pasted into the website field, or by uploading a text file. The DBs return a .csv file that includes the names (other annotations, such as cellular locations or GO terms, can be included, if desired):\n",
    "\n",
    "https://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/app/search/transcript/GeneByLocusTag\n",
    "https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/search/transcript/GeneByLocusTag\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the list of gene IDs, click \"Get Answer\". When the results table appears, there will be a tab called \"Analyze Results\". From this you will be able to select either \"Gene Ontology Enrichment\" or \"Metabolic Pathway Enrichment\". Select the GO analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results can be downloaded as a .csv file, and the results filtered by (p-value or) bonferroni adjusted p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metabolic Pathways\n",
    "Similarly to above, you will need either a text list of gene IDs, this time for ‘up’ and ‘down’ separately. This can be submitted to the respective DB tools for metabolic pathway analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/app/search/pathway/PathwaysByGeneList\n",
    "https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/search/pathway/PathwaysByGeneList\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the list of gene IDs, click \"Get Answer\". The search function offers a few different ‘Pathway Sources’ (KEGG, LeishCyc, MetaCyc and TrypanoCyc for T. brucei). Start with \"Any\" and include all of them, the hit list can be subsequently filtered by source, if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pathways with hits can be downloaded as .csv file, and the results can be customized in terms of the columns that should be included, such as ‘Total Pathway Enzymes’, ‘Unique Gene Counts’ (i.e. hits in that pathway), EC numbers etc."
