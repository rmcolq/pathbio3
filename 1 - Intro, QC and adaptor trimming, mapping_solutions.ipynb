If you need to revisit the presentation where we introduced RNAseq and the example dataset, you can find it on Learn, in the \"Workshop 1\" folder. You will also find the original paper where this dataset was published, and some review articles about RNA-Seq analysis methods. These are not compulsory reading, but may be of interest and are worth a look.\n",

    "## The command line\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the first and second year courses focused on teaching coding in python, another key skill in biology is to run specialized existing software. Some of these can be installed as python modules, but many real-world tools are run \"on the command line\". This means that they run like an application or program, but the user types commands in a \"shell\" or \"terminal\" instead of clicking/swiping in an interactive window. Within the notebook environment, these commands can be run in 3 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* adding `%%bash` to the top of a cell\n",
    "* adding a `!` to the start of the command in a cell\n",
    "* (sometimes) if the command can only be interpreted in bash, jupyter sometimes doesn't need to be told. There is a really excellent (short) primer to the command line which can be found [here](https://cyverse-leptin-rna-seq-lesson-dev.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/section-3.html) and gives a description of the most common commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this (and subsequent) workshops, we will combine code that is written on the command line (for which the full command will be provided) and questions which will require you to use the python coding you have already learnt."

    "Hopefully in the previous exercises it has become clear that sequencing DNA is not error-free - each base of the sequence is read with a degree of uncertainty and error - and that our data definitely has some low quality reads (and parts of reads). Each sequencing machine/method results in different error profiles. To improve our analysis we first want to filter the lowest quality reads. One tool commonly used to profile the amounts of error is [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). "

In particular, this removes entire read pairs if at least one of the two sequences became shorter than a certain threshold. `--fastqc` automatically runs FastQC after trimming. `--basename` specifies the preferred prefix of output files.\n",
    "7. For read 1 of ERR022872, the trimmed report tells us that the average read quality does not drop off as much towards the end of the read. The per-base sequence content is still more variable at the starts of the reads, but no longer at the ends of the reads. The overrepresented primers and adaptors have now been removed.\n",
